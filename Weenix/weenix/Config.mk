# This file is meant to change some aspect of how weenix is built or run.

# Variables in this file should meet the following criteria:
# * They change some behavior in the building or running of weenix that someone
#   using weenix for educational purposes could reasonably want to change on a regular
#   basis. Note that variables like CFLAGS are not defined here because they should
#   generally not be changed.

#
# Setting any of these variables will control which parts of the source tree
# are built. To enable something set it to 1, otherwise set it to 0.
#
     DRIVERS=1
         VFS=1
        S5FS=0
          VM=0
     DYNAMIC=0
# When you finish S5FS, first enable "VM"; once this is working, then enable
# "DYNAMIC".

#
# Set the number of terminals that we should be launching.
#
        NTERMS=3

#
# Set the number of disks that we should be launching
#
        NDISKS=1

# Switches for non-required components. If you wish to try implementing
# some extra features in Weenix, there are some pre-designed features
# you can add. Turn on one of these flags and re-compile Weenix. Please
# see the Wiki for details on what is provided by changing these flags
# and what you will need to implement to complete them, of course you
# are always free to implement your own features as well. Remember, though
# these features are not "extra-credit" they are purely for academic
# interest. The most important thing is that you have a working core
# implementation, and that is what you will be graded on. If you decide
# to implement extra features please make sure your core Weenix is working
# first, and make sure to make a copy of your working Weenix before you
# go breaking it, which we promise you will happen.

# Debug message behavior. Note that this can be changed at runtime by
