/*
 * This gets called by _pt_fault_handler in mm/pagetable.c The
 * calling function has already done a lot of error checking for
 * us. In particular it has checked that we are not page faulting
 * while in kernel mode. Make sure you understand why an
 * unexpected page fault in kernel mode is bad in Weenix. You
 * should probably read the _pt_fault_handler function to get a
 * sense of what it is doing.
 *
 * Before you can do anything you need to find the vmarea that
 * contains the address that was faulted on. Make sure to check
 * the permissions on the area to see if the process has
 * permission to do [cause]. If either of these checks does not
 * pass kill the offending process, setting its exit status to
 * EFAULT (normally we would send the SIGSEGV signal, however
 * Weenix does not support signals).
 *
 * Now it is time to find the correct page (don't forget
 * about shadow objects, especially copy-on-write magic!). Make
 * sure that if the user writes to the page it will be handled
 * correctly.
 *
 * Finally call pt_map to have the new mapping placed into the
 * appropriate page table.
 *
 * @param vaddr the address that was accessed to cause the fault
 *
 * @param cause this is the type of operation on the memory
 *              address which caused the fault, possible values
 *              can be found in pagefault.h
